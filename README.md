## Inspiration
#### Overall
Petitions are a powerful way for citizens to voice their concerns and influence government policy. However, tracking the progress of petitions - such as how many signatures they gather, how long it takes for the government to respond, and when debates are scheduled - can be difficult to follow. This app was created to provide an easy-to-use, interactive platform to explore UK petitions data, making these insights more accessible to everyone.

#### Personal
My interest in this project was sparked by a recent immigration policy announcement. On May 12, 2025, the UK Prime Minister unveiled a white paper proposing significant changes to immigration laws, including extending the path to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) for Skilled Workers from 5 to 10 years. This news deeply impacted the immigrant community.

On May 23, 2025, a [petition opposing these changes](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/727360) was launched on the UK Parliament petitions website. Within just two days, it collected over 100,000 signatures, qualifying it for a parliamentary debate.

During this period, I closely monitored the petition’s signature count and became curious about how long it usually takes the government to respond and schedule debates once the threshold is reached. To answer this and share these insights, I created this app to visualize statistics.
